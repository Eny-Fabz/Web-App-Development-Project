      <h2>About the Community Fundraising Portal</h2>
      <p>
        The Strathmore Community Fundraising Portal is designed to centralize all charitable campaigns
        across the Strathmore University community. Students, staff, faculty, and affiliated NGOs can
        create, share, and support causes in one unified platform. Our mission is to foster a culture
        of giving and transparency, enabling contributors to see the direct impact of their donations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Built with React, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this portal offers features such as secure payment
        integration, campaign updates, progress tracking, and more. We aim to simplify fundraising
        workflows and empower every member of Strathmore University to make a difference.
